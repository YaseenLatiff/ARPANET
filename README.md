# ARPANET Updated
This is the updated version of my groups password manager. I had originally done the entire python backend for the project
with some help from kevashen pillay +27 83 271 8379 in terms of providing python access to the database with SQL. I also did the ajax statements for sending
the data between python and javascript and was responsible for the encryption and decryption system used. Kevashen also helped me with some of the javascript.
The entire project uses python Flask for the backend and uses ajax statements to communicate to the python backend with javascript. Onwabe Zibeke +27 78 430 0901 
and Mesuli Shandu +27 84 042 7505 originally did the design for the home page, login and registration page. I handled the design of the password manager page. Their original designs were great and were well designed. The plan for this project is to deploy it so it is freely acccessible to everyone. Right now I am in the process of 
improving and perfecting its main functionality. Once that is done I will deploy this and if I have time will update it as I go on.

## EDIT #1 2022/12/28-
### Things that I changed are: 
* The design in terms of how the buttons and other areas looked
* The design of the entire password manager page
* I added more scripts to give better functionality 
* I added more code to the python backend to add to the functionality of the system

To see the older version please check the main branch.

## EDIT #2 2022/12/29-
### New changes baby:
* I improved the designs even more especially for the passoword manager screens.
* We can finally CRUD!! Before in EDIT #1 we could only create new passwords now we can edit each record and delete a record. Amazing yeaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

We are almost done. I just want to spruce up the design and test it a bit. Once that is done I will deploy the web application. I may have to change the database. but thats cool. We are almost done baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
