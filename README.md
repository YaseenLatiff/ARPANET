# ARPANET
This is the older version of my groups password manager. I had originally done the entire python backend for the projectwith some help from kevashen pillay +27 83 271 8379 in terms of providing python access to the database with SQL. I also did the ajax statements for sending
the data between python and javascript and was responsible for the encryption and decryption system used. Kevashen also helped me with some of the javascript.
The entire project uses python Flask for the backend and uses ajax statements to communicate to the python backend with javascript. Onwabe Zibeke +27 78 430 0901 
and Mesuli Shandu +27 84 042 7505 originally did the design for the home page, login and registration page. I handled the design of the password manager page. Their original designs were great and were well designed. The plan for this project is to deploy it so it is freely acccessible to everyone. Right now I am in the process of 
improving and perfecting its main functionality. Once that is done I will deploy this and if I have time will update it as I go on. 

To see the updated version please go to the master branch
